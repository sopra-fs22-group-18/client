## Launch & Deployment
### Tutorials
First you have to get an idea of the used technology. For that we'll give you some links to get used to the used languages, libraries etc.
Next you'll get a step-by-step tutorial what to download and how to launch & deploy.<br/><br/>
Read and go through these Tutorials!
- [Getting started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Practical React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) <br/>

Get an understanding of:
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax)
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

Two important technologies used in this programm:
- [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- [react-hooks](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks)

### Download Dependencies

Now we are getting to the prerequisits of the deployment. You'll need Node.js to deploy. You can download it here:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

To download are dependencies for local deployment, run the following line in the terminal. First navigate with the terminal into your client code file using:
```
cd 'your/path/onYour/machine/toThe/client/file'
```
Then run this on the terminal

```
npm install
```
This might take a while. After the download is completed, you can go deploy locally. 

### Local Deployment
Deploy the application by running this on your terminal:
```
npm run dev
```
Normally the local deployment pops up by itself. If it doesn't, use this to view the deployment on your browser:
- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

When you edit the code in your IDE while the code is deploying locally, the browser will reload the page automatically and you can see your changes immediatly. <br/>
You can also see the console outputs and errors in the browser console (use google chrome).

### Testing
You can run the tests with
```
npm run test
```
Consider that testing is optional and that the tests are launched in an interactive watch mode.<br/>
For more testing information see: [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) <br/>
If you are a ```MacOS``` user and running into a ```fsevents``` error: 
[see here](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423)

### Build
Running
```
npm run build
```
in the terminal builds the app for production to the ```build``` folder. <br/>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.

## Roadmap
1. In the future, you could set up a lobby where you can wait for participants to enter after the game starts. 
2. In addition, it would be useful to be able to see your own post and comment history. 
3. It would also be interesting if users could send voice messages or videos while "roasting" pictures.
